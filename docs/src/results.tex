Figure \ref{fig:ivalue} displays the log-frequency and Entropy of words, along with the value of the respective metric. As we can see (both in the User-Count and Word-Count plots) the words we rank high in our lists are those closer to the upper-left of the plot â€” that is, highly-concentrated and occurring a consideriable number of times. Mixed Information Value seems to respect the User-Count order, and the last plot shows that although User-Count and Word-Count ranks are similar, they are not exactly the same as shown by the ``darker'' points close to the upper-left corner.

Regarding the lexicographic validation, Table \ref{tab:metric_results} display the percentage of words marked as being lexicographically interesting. The number of users of a word alone seems to be the most informative feature.
